<p>Hi, I'm Sue and I'm trying to learn programing for a fun hobbie. I already knit and like reading but wanted a computer based hobbie too. My dad was a wiz with anything electrical and 2 of my brothers work in computing so would also like something to talk with them about</p>

<p>I'm 36 years old from Haslingden in North West England. I've been with my fella for 19 year and we have 2 amazing kids, our daughter who's 10 and our son who's nearly 2. I work full time so love to find new and interesting things to do with my kids to make amazing memories together.</p>
